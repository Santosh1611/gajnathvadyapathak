                'Gajnath Vadya Pathak' Pune was established in 2017. The idea of having a special class to bring in the
                culture of Maharashtra and retain the folk art form was implemented. The pathak performs on traditional
                Indian drums and instruments. It believes in bringing discipline to music.

                Gajnath was founded by 11 experienced shoulders using only 10 dhols and 4 tashas. Up until now, the
                count has reached 60 dhol and 18 tashas.

                At the very beginning, Gajnath had 30 members. The total number of members has now risen to 110,
                representing all age groups and including the active participation of women.
                <!-- Members of the pathak gather daily at the practice locations to brush up on their dhol-tasha skills. Training for the upcoming
                events starts a few months prior. -->
